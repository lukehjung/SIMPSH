Some limitations of my code are that the syntax for each command is really specific.
Meaning that there's not really good option parsing for writing syntax that might be a little
off or other errors.  Also, if there was some code that exploited a certain function,
I couldn't check whether the command itself was written well because it just executes
given the options.

Extra features that I have include that I set each dynamic array to size 10, so it doesn't take 
as much memory and reallocate memory in increments of 10.  Also, the error checking is pretty broad,
it doesn't specify the exact error but more of a concept of what went wrong.
